Handwritten Digit Classifier w/ Neural Network:
  A neural network based on the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits. 
  Requires the following libraries:
    - Numpy (https://scipy.org/install/)
    - Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html)
    
Multi-Agent Pacman Solver:
  A reflex agent designed to solve the classic version of Pacman using search algorithms such as 
  Minimax, Expectimax, and Alpha-Beta Pruning to find the best (most consistent) methods to beat Pacman. 
  
Both projects were built in Python 3.
